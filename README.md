# Front end
I created a vue-cli based project that can be run with the following commands.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
yarn test
```
I didn't write extensive unit tests, but just a single one for now due to time constraints. On most front end projects I aim for 80% unit test coverage, and would also build out e2e tests via cypress.

### Data for frontend
The main array of questions for the fronend is located at
```
src/data/SurveyData.js
```
___

# Backend documentation
```
Prompt-Backend.md
```
This contains all the data models and list of functions that I think would be used for the Appointment/Employee Utilization question.
